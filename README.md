A mod made to work with Melon Loader (https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/download/v0.6.6/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) for a smoother user experience, increases all character sliders by 2x. you also do not need to create a character before the slider limits take effect. Only visible to others with the mod.

# PLANNED FEATURES

- ~~A fully uncapped chat command is in the works (Scale bugs beware)~~

- Normalized scales, so 0 is default min and 100 is default max (this is not a cap, just to make scales more consistent)

- ~~Uncapped camera zoom, toggle to have camera height change with player height~~

- ~~separate uncapped player level to different mod~~

- ~~fork to bepin~~

- ~~add more body part name variety to allow other names to work eg. "Ass, butt, bottom" or boobs, boob, tits, tit"~~


- ~~add proportional scale for width and height, to allow for easy resizing without "getting stretched"~~

- ~~fix slider limits~~
